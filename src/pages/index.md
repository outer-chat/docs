</p>

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in early developpment.

## Quick look üì∏

**outer.chat** is an open-source alternative to Discord, built with NestJS and Prisma. It provides a REST API for standard requests and utilizes WebRTC and Socket.io for real-time communication.

## Features üéâ

- **Real-time communication** : With WebRTC and Socket.io, you can communicate with your friends in real-time.
- **Open-source** : You can contribute to the project and see the code.
- **Self-hosted** : You can host the application on your own server.
- **Customizable** : You can customize the application to match your needs thanks to admin permissions.

## Installation üß∞

### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:outer-chat/outer-chat.git --recurse-submodules
cd outer-chat
npm install
```

Now edit the `.env` file to match your configuration. (you can use the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file as an example)
Now you can start the server in developpement mode with :

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Or in production mode with :

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

**Note** : If you do not want to setup a database, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project. It will launch a postgres database. You can edit the env variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### With Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

As said earlier, this snippet only up the database. If you want to up the whole stack, you can use the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file at the root of the project.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

As you may, you can edit the env variables in the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file.
And edit the Caddyfile to match your domain.

Note that the `docker-compose.prod.yml` also launch the clientapp. If not already done, I invite you to pull the submodule located in : `./outer-chat.client`.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

For any question about the clientapp, please refer to the README of the clientapp.

## Documentation üìë

For end users, you can see the api documentation when the server is started at the `/api` route. (eg. `http://localhost:3000/api`)
For further documentation, (the developer documentation), you can access it in the [docs](docs) folder.

## Running tests üß™

At the moment, there is only e2e tests. They should cover the major part of the application.

```bash
npm install
npm run test:e2e
```
